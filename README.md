# Daily_Leet_code_2023

Welcome to Daily Leet Code 2023! This repository is dedicated to providing you with daily coding exercises and challenges from LeetCode in the C++ programming language. It aims to help you improve your problem-solving skills, explore various algorithms and data structures, and stay engaged with coding on a daily basis.

## Getting Started

This section provides information on how to set up the project and get it running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run the exercises and challenges in this repository, you will need the following:

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or any other compatible compiler)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Setup and Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Daily_Leet_Code_2023.git
   ```

2. Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.

3. Install any required extensions recommended by VS Code for C++ development.

4. You are now ready to start solving LeetCode problems!

## Usage

The repository contains a collection of daily coding exercises and challenges from LeetCode in C++. Each day, a new problem will be provided to help you practice different aspects of programming and problem-solving.

1. Start by navigating to the `problems` directory.

2. Choose the problem for the day. Each problem is provided in a separate file.

3. Open the file in VS Code and start coding your solution.

4. Use the C++ compiler of your choice to build and run the code.

5. Test your solution with different test cases and verify that it produces the expected output.

6. Optimize your solution if possible, considering time and space complexity.

7. Repeat the process every day to enhance your problem-solving skills and gain familiarity with LeetCode-style questions.
